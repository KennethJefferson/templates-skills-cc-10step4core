## Truth 1: Expertise Transfer, Not Instructions

**Does the skill make Claude THINK like an expert, not follow steps?**

- [ ] Mental model describes HOW to think, not WHAT to do
- [ ] Decision framework captures judgment calls, not procedures
- [ ] Explains WHY experts make choices, not just what they choose
- [ ] Transfers intuition: "When you see X, suspect Y"
- [ ] Avoids numbered step lists (unless truly necessary)

**Red flags** (if any are true, revise):
- [ ] Reads like a user manual
- [ ] Says "First... Then... Next... Finally..."
- [ ] Could be followed mechanically without understanding
- [ ] Expert would say "that's technically correct but misses the point"

**Score**: [ ] Pass [ ] Needs Work

## Truth 2: Flow, Not Friction

**Does the skill produce output directly, without intermediate artifacts?**

- [ ] Goes straight to deliverable
- [ ] No "planning phase" or "analysis document" requirements
- [ ] Internal reasoning stays internal
- [ ] User gets output, not process documentation
- [ ] Minimal preamble before action

**Red flags** (if any are true, revise):
- [ ] Requires creating intermediate documents
- [ ] Multiple phases before output
- [ ] Process is more prominent than result
- [ ] User has to read through analysis to find the answer

**Score**: [ ] Pass [ ] Needs Work

## Truth 3: Voice Matches Domain

**Does the skill sound like a practitioner, not documentation?**

- [ ] Uses domain-specific vocabulary correctly
- [ ] Tone matches how practitioners actually communicate
- [ ] Examples sound like expert explaining to peer
- [ ] Avoids generic/bureaucratic language
- [ ] Would pass the "would an expert cringe?" test

**Red flags** (if any are true, revise):
- [ ] Reads like Wikipedia or a textbook
- [ ] Uses "shall," "must," "the system will"
- [ ] Sounds like it was written by someone outside the domain
- [ ] Overly formal or stilted

**Score**: [ ] Pass [ ] Needs Work

## Truth 4: Focused Beats Comprehensive

**Does every section earn its place?**

- [ ] SKILL.md body is under 500 lines
- [ ] Each section addresses a specific need identified in exploration
- [ ] No redundancy with Claude's base capabilities
- [ ] Details moved to references/ files, not crammed into SKILL.md
- [ ] Deleted 20% in compression pass

**The deletion test** (for each section):
- [ ] If deleted, skill quality would decrease
- [ ] Content is not already known to Claude
- [ ] Not "nice to have"—essential

**Red flags** (if any are true, revise):
- [ ] Sections titled "Overview," "Introduction," "Background"
- [ ] "Best practices" lists without specific context
- [ ] Explaining things Claude already knows
- [ ] "Just in case" information

**Score**: [ ] Pass [ ] Needs Work

## Structural Check

- [ ] Frontmatter description includes ALL trigger conditions
- [ ] No "When to use this skill" in body (belongs in description)
- [ ] References files are referenced from SKILL.md with clear guidance
- [ ] Scripts are tested and functional
- [ ] No README.md or auxiliary documentation files
