<!--
TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS (delete this block when using):

This template embeds the 4 Core Truths. Each section includes guidance
on how to write it correctly. Delete all HTML comments before finalizing.

Core Truths to maintain:
1. Expertise Transfer > Instructions (think like expert, not follow steps)
2. Flow > Friction (output directly, no intermediate docs)
3. Voice Matches Domain (practitioner, not documentation)
4. Focused > Comprehensive (every line earns its place)
-->

## Mental Model

<!--
EXPERTISE TRANSFER: Don't list steps. Describe how an expert THINKS.
Example of what NOT to write:
  "First analyze X, then check Y, then produce Z"

Example of what TO write:
  "Approach this like a [role] who's seen hundreds of these. Your first
  instinct is to check [key signal] because [expert reasoning]. When you
  see [pattern], it usually means [insight novices miss]."
-->

[Describe how an expert approaches this domain. What's their mindset? What do they notice first? What patterns trigger their attention?]

## Core Workflow

<!--
FLOW, NOT FRICTION: Go straight to output. No planning docs, no analysis
phases, no intermediate artifacts unless the USER needs them.

Keep this section SHORT. 3-7 items max. If you need more, you're being
too comprehensive.
-->

[The essential actions. What does the expert actually DO? Not process—actions that produce output.]

## Decision Framework

<!--
EXPERTISE TRANSFER: This is where tacit knowledge lives. What decisions
does an expert make that a novice wouldn't even know to consider?

Format as decision points, not steps:
  "When [situation], [expert choice] because [reasoning]"
-->

| When You See... | Do This | Because... |
|-----------------|---------|------------|
| [Situation 1] | [Action] | [Expert reasoning] |
| [Situation 2] | [Action] | [Expert reasoning] |
| [Situation 3] | [Action] | [Expert reasoning] |

## Quality Markers

<!--
EXPERTISE TRANSFER: How does an expert recognize good vs. bad output?
These become your internal quality checks.
-->

**Good output has:**
- [Observable quality 1]
- [Observable quality 2]

**Watch out for:**
- [Common mistake experts catch immediately]
- [Subtle issue novices miss]

## Examples

<!--
VOICE MATCHES DOMAIN: These examples should sound like a practitioner
explaining to a peer, not documentation for a user.

Include 1-2 examples max. More examples = reference file.
-->

**Scenario**: [Brief setup]

**Expert approach**: [How a practitioner would handle this, in their voice]

**Output**: [What the deliverable looks like]

<!--
FOCUSED BEATS COMPREHENSIVE:

Before adding ANY additional sections, ask:
- Does Claude already know this? (Delete if yes)
- Is this essential for expert-quality output? (Move to references/ if no)
- Can I make this shorter? (Always yes)

Common sections to AVOID unless truly necessary:
- "Overview" (redundant with mental model)
- "Prerequisites" (Claude figures this out)
- "Troubleshooting" (belongs in references/)
- "Advanced Topics" (belongs in references/)
- Anything titled "Best Practices" (too vague—be specific or delete)
