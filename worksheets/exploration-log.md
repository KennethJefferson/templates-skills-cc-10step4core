# Exploration Log

Use this worksheet during Step 2: EXPLORE to document where Claude fails without the skill.

## Test Cases

For each test case, document what happens when Claude attempts the task with NO skill guidance.

### Test Case 1

**Task**: [What you asked Claude to do]

**Claude's Approach**: [How did Claude attempt it?]

**Failure Type** (check all that apply):
- [ ] Wrong approach chosen
- [ ] Missing domain knowledge  
- [ ] Poor output format
- [ ] Inefficient workflow
- [ ] Missed edge case
- [ ] Wrong assumptions
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Specific Failure**: [Exactly what went wrong]

**What an expert would do differently**: [The correct approach]

**Skill Requirement**: [What the skill must provide to prevent this failure]
