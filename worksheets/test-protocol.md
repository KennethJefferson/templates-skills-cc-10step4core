# Test Protocol

Use during Step 8: TEST to validate your skill against real scenarios.

## Skill Being Tested: _______________

## Test Cases

Use the same test cases from your Exploration Log (Step 2), plus edge cases.

---

### Test Case 1 (from Exploration)

**Original Task**: [Copy from exploration log]

**Original Failure**: [What went wrong without the skill]

**With Skill - Attempt**:
- Date tested:
- Output produced:

**Evaluation**:
- [ ] Expert-quality output
- [ ] Acceptable output  
- [ ] Still failing

**If failing, what's missing from the skill?**

**Action**: [ ] No change needed [ ] Update skill (describe below)

---

### Test Case 2 (from Exploration)

**Original Task**: 

**Original Failure**: 

**With Skill - Attempt**:
- Date tested:
- Output produced:

**Evaluation**:
- [ ] Expert-quality output
- [ ] Acceptable output  
- [ ] Still failing

**If failing, what's missing from the skill?**

**Action**: [ ] No change needed [ ] Update skill

---

### Test Case 3 (from Exploration)

**Original Task**: 

**Original Failure**: 

**With Skill - Attempt**:
- Date tested:
- Output produced:

**Evaluation**:
- [ ] Expert-quality output
- [ ] Acceptable output  
- [ ] Still failing

**If failing, what's missing from the skill?**

**Action**: [ ] No change needed [ ] Update skill

## Edge Cases

Test scenarios that practitioners would recognize but novices wouldn't anticipate.

### Edge Case 1: [Name]

**Scenario**: [Tricky situation an expert would handle differently]

**Expected Expert Behavior**: [What should happen]

**Actual Behavior**: 

**Pass**: [ ] Yes [ ] No

---

### Edge Case 2: [Name]

**Scenario**: 

**Expected Expert Behavior**: 

**Actual Behavior**: 

**Pass**: [ ] Yes [ ] No

---

### Edge Case 3: [Name]

**Scenario**: 

**Expected Expert Behavior**: 

**Actual Behavior**: 

**Pass**: [ ] Yes [ ] No

---

## Regression Check

After making any skill updates, re-test previous passing cases.

| Test Case | Still Passing? | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | [ ] Yes [ ] No | |
| 2 | [ ] Yes [ ] No | |
| 3 | [ ] Yes [ ] No | |
| Edge 1 | [ ] Yes [ ] No | |
| Edge 2 | [ ] Yes [ ] No | |
| Edge 3 | [ ] Yes [ ] No | |
